# /research

Evidence-backed research. The lead owns framing, source weighting, synthesis,
and residual uncertainty.

`/research` routes by capability, not vendor. Exa, xAI, Brave, Perplexity,
Context7, Tavily, Firecrawl, browser agents, and provider lanes are acquisition
tools behind a small set of evidence jobs: repo truth, docs lookup, web
retrieval, code/context examples, extraction, social/discourse, recency
verification, and synthesis.

## Route

| Need | Load |
|---|---|
| broad research, comparison, architecture prior art, or discourse scan | `references/default-fanout.md` |
| `web-search`, `web-deep`, `web-news`, `web-docs` | `references/web-search.md` |
| Exa search/fetch/deep/MCP/code context | `references/exa-tools.md` |
| extraction, site maps, crawls | `references/extraction-tools.md` |
| `delegate` | `references/delegate.md` |
| `introspect` | `references/introspect.md` |
| `readwise` | `references/readwise.md` |
| `xai` | `references/xai-search.md` |
| `exemplars` | `references/exemplars.md` |

If the user names a sub-capability, load that reference. Otherwise use the
default fanout for substantive research; narrow to one source only for explicit
single-source requests or simple fact/version lookups.

Model selection/comparison is research, not memory: model facts rot in
weeks. Start from the installed roster skill's
`references/model-provider-harness-index.md` for current local facts, then
verify against live sources — availability on the target platform, pricing,
context, tool-calling support — and return a ranked recommendation with
dates on every claim.

## Contract

- Read the live repo first for repo facts.
- Use current external sources for drift-prone facts.
- Keep provider CLIs and web tools thin: launch, bound, record.
- Prefer acquisition surfaces in this order when available: MCP tool first,
  local CLI wrapper second, direct REST/API call third, built-in WebSearch last.
- Treat web search, extraction, X/social search, provider lanes, and
  local grep as evidence inputs, not substitutes for lead synthesis.
- Do not let synthesis stand in for retrieval. A grounded answer may summarize
  sources, but the source URLs/artifacts remain the proof.
- Separate source evidence from conclusions; cite URLs, files, commands,
  receipts, or artifacts for claims.
- Label skipped, failed, stale, in-flight, and partial sources.
- Report residual uncertainty instead of smoothing over missing evidence.

## Delegation Judgment

Delegate per the shared Roster contract (shared AGENTS.md: Roster).

Local lane guidance: Use lanes with distinct sources, methods, or model families; web search and provider CLIs are evidence inputs, not substitutes for lead synthesis.

## Completion Gate

See `primitives/shared/AGENTS.md` (Completion Evidence) for the shared core.
`/research` adds:

- Sources/tools queried and why.
- Provider lanes, receipt ids, accepted/rejected outputs, and failures.
- Source coverage gaps, stale facts, and skipped tools.

## Gotchas

- A single WebSearch is a lookup, not substantive research.
- Mandatory source structure belongs in `references/default-fanout.md`; keep
  vendor command recipes in tool references.
