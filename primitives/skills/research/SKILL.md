# /research

Evidence-backed research. The lead owns framing, source weighting, synthesis,
and residual uncertainty.

`/research` routes by capability, not vendor. Exa, xAI, Brave, Perplexity,
Context7, Tavily, Firecrawl, browser agents, and provider lanes are acquisition
tools behind a small set of evidence jobs: repo truth, docs lookup, web
retrieval, code/context examples, extraction, social/discourse, recency
verification, and synthesis.

## Route

| Need | Load |
|---|---|
| broad research, comparison, architecture prior art, or discourse scan | `references/default-fanout.md` |
| `web-search`, `web-deep`, `web-news`, `web-docs` | `references/web-search.md` |
| Exa search/fetch/deep/MCP/code context | `references/exa-tools.md` |
| extraction, site maps, crawls | `references/extraction-tools.md` |
| `delegate` | `references/delegate.md` |
| `introspect` | `references/introspect.md` |
| `readwise` | `references/readwise.md` |
| `xai` | `references/xai-search.md` |
| `exemplars` | `references/exemplars.md` |

If the user names a sub-capability, load that reference. Otherwise use the
default fanout for substantive research; narrow to one source only for explicit
single-source requests or simple fact/version lookups.

Model selection/comparison is research, not memory: model facts rot in
weeks. Start from
`primitives/skills/roster/references/model-provider-harness-index.md` for
current local facts, then verify against live sources — availability on the
target platform, pricing, context, tool-calling support — and return a ranked
recommendation with dates on every claim.

## Contract

- Read the live repo first for repo facts; use current external sources for
  drift-prone facts.
- Prefer acquisition surfaces in this order when available: MCP tool, local CLI
  wrapper, direct REST/API, built-in WebSearch last.
- Retrieval and synthesis are distinct jobs: source URLs/files/receipts are the
  proof, your synthesis is the conclusion. Cite the source for every claim; a
  summary never stands in for it.
- Label skipped, failed, stale, in-flight, and partial sources; report residual
  uncertainty rather than smoothing over gaps.

## Delegation Judgment

Delegate per the Shared Operating Spine (Act). A lane earns
its spend only by carrying distinct sources, methods, or model families.

## Completion Gate

See `primitives/shared/AGENTS.md` (Prove) for the shared core.
`/research` adds:

- Sources/tools queried and why.
- Provider lanes, receipt ids, accepted/rejected outputs, and failures.
- Source coverage gaps, stale facts, and skipped tools.

## Gotchas

- A single WebSearch is a lookup, not substantive research.
- Mandatory source structure belongs in `references/default-fanout.md`; keep
  vendor command recipes in tool references.
