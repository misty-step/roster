  Browser-mode-only Oracle consults: bundle a prompt plus selected files and ask
  a signed-in ChatGPT GPT-5.5 Pro browser session for a second opinion. Use
  when stuck, debugging hard bugs, reviewing an architecture plan, or
  cross-checking a substantive diff with large file context. Never use Oracle
  API mode from Roster. Trigger: /oracle, /consult.

# /oracle

Use Oracle only as a browser-backed consult surface. It bundles the prompt and
selected files, opens a signed-in ChatGPT browser session, and stores the
answer under `~/.oracle/sessions`. The lead agent still owns synthesis,
verification, and final judgment.

## Hard Boundary

- Always pass `--engine browser`.
- Prefer `--model gpt-5.5-pro` unless the operator names another browser model.
- Never run `--engine api`, `--provider openai`, `--no-azure`, `--models`, or
  API preflight from this skill.
- If an Oracle command would need an API key or per-token billing, do not use
  Oracle for that work from Roster; use the normal roster/research paths
  instead.

## Workflow

1. Pick the tightest file set that contains the truth. Exclude tests, snapshots,
   generated output, and fixtures unless they are the oracle.
2. Preview first:

   ```sh
   npx -y @steipete/oracle --engine browser --model gpt-5.5-pro \
     --dry-run summary --files-report \
     -p "<task>" --file "src/**" --file "!**/*.test.*"
   ```

3. Run only after the preview is sensible:

   ```sh
   npx -y @steipete/oracle --engine browser --model gpt-5.5-pro \
     --slug "<3-5-words>" \
     -p "<task>" --file "src/**" --file "!**/*.test.*"
   ```

4. If the run detaches or times out, do not re-run. Inspect the stored session:

   ```sh
   npx -y @steipete/oracle status --hours 72
   npx -y @steipete/oracle session <id> --render
   ```

## Good Prompts

Oracle starts cold. Include the repo goal, relevant commands, exact failure,
constraints, and desired output shape. Critics get the artifact and the
oracle only — never the author's reasoning trail (Shared Operating Spine:
Prove).

Good output requests:

- `Return blockers only, with file/line evidence.`
- `Challenge this plan; list missing proof, wrong assumptions, and safer alternatives.`
- `Find the likely root cause and the smallest verification loop.`

## Safety

- Do not attach secrets, `.env`, key files, tokens, browser profiles, or private
  customer data.
- Use `--dry-run summary --files-report` before every real run.
- Treat Oracle output as advisory evidence. Verify with the repo's live oracle,
  tests, gate, browser route, or command before claiming done.
- Browser mode is cheaper than API billing but can be slow and subject to
  ChatGPT subscription limits.
