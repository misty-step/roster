  Use when an agent needs to inspect, claim, update, request input for, or
  complete work cards in a Powder instance. Powder is the self-hostable,
  agent-first work board: a durable card store with run sessions, activity,
  audit events, relations, optional proof, and human-in-loop states.

# Powder

Powder is a self-hostable work tool. It exposes one core through API, CLI, MCP,
and this skill. Treat cards as context objects with acceptance oracles, not
status rows. Real card data belongs in a deployed instance database, not in the
product repository. Read `VISION.md` before changing Powder's product scope,
card/run model, runner boundary, or self-hosting assumptions.

For local MCP use, set `POWDER_DB_PATH` to the instance SQLite database. To
reach a deployed instance instead, set `POWDER_API_BASE_URL` (and
`POWDER_API_KEY`). One of these two must be set — MCP refuses to start
otherwise; there is no ephemeral in-memory mode, since claims and completions
must never silently evaporate on process exit.

## Operating Contract

- Use `list_ready` before claiming work.
- Claim exactly one card at a time unless the operator authorizes a batch.
- Keep the card updated through lease heartbeats, renewals, audit events,
  relations, and status changes.
- Release the claim when stopping voluntarily so another worker can pick the
  card up immediately.
- In API-key mode, claim as the authenticated key actor; do not supply another
  agent name to impersonate a different worker.
- Use `get_card`, `get_run`, and `list_awaiting_input` to read timelines before
  answering or completing work.
- Use `request_input` when a human decision is needed; do not invent approvals.
- Use `answer_input` only with an actor and the actual answer text.
- Use `update_status` or `complete_card` to record the current truth; proof is
  optional, and Powder audits the actor/time/change instead of enforcing a
  lifecycle matrix.
- Do not spawn agents from Powder core. Dispatch belongs to a separate runner.

## Expected MCP Tools

- `list_ready`: return claimable cards sorted by priority, age, and identifier.
- `list_cards`: enumerate cards by optional status/repo filter, including
  `blocked`, `review`, and `done` cards `list_ready` never surfaces.
- `claim_card`: acquire an expiring lock for one card and open a run.
- `release_claim`: clear an active claim by run id and make the card ready.
- `renew_claim`: extend an active claim lease by run id.
- `heartbeat`: record liveness for an active claim without changing ownership.
- `get_card`: read one card with runs, activities, links, comments, and claim state.
- `get_run`: read one run with its card, activities, links, comments, and run state.
- `list_awaiting_input`: list runs paused for human or agent input.
- `answer_input`: append an actor-attributed answer and resume the run.
- `update_status`: set a card to any status in one call and record an audit event.
- `update_relations`: replace a card's `related`, `blocks`, and `blocked_by`
  relation lists.
- `add_link`: attach a PR, CI run, artifact, or reference URL to a card.
- `add_comment`: attach an actor-attributed comment, visible immediately via
  `get_card`/`get_run`.
- `request_input`: move the run to `awaiting_input` with the exact question.
- `complete_card`: mark the card done, optionally attaching proof.

## Red Lines

- Do not import from Gradient or Hermes `kanban.db`.
- Do not create or consume a repository-local ticket directory.
- Do not add personal or operator backlog data to the Powder repository.
- Do not treat exit zero as completion without a status update and audit trail.
