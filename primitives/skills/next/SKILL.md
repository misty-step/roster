  Recommend the best next move from live thread and repo state. Use when:
  "what's next", "what next", "now what", "what should I do next",
  "what should we do next", "anything else to do", "where are we now,
  what's next", "what next in the backlog". Trigger: /next, /what-next,
  /now-what.

# /next

Answer the operator's recurring "what's next?" with a concrete recommendation,
not a strategy essay. Read-only by default.

## Contract

Ground first, then choose one next move. The output must separate agent-owned
work from user-owned external actions.

Use `--act-if-safe` only for reversible evidence gathering or mechanical checks:
status, branch, recent commits, backlog listing, open PR lookup, or reading the
current plan. Do not edit, commit, merge, push, message people, spend money, or
change external systems under `--act-if-safe`.

## Grounding

Read the smallest useful surface for the scope:

- current user ask and visible thread context
- `git status --short --branch --untracked-files=all` when in a repo
- active branch, upstream, dirty/unpushed state, and recent commits
- the board of record when work priority is in scope: Powder queues via the
  powder MCP/CLI (`list_ready`, plus `in_progress`, `verification`, and
  `blocked`/prerequisite-bearing cards); a file-based repo uses `backlog.d/*.md`
- root `VISION.md` when the next move depends on product direction,
  positioning, project identity, or long-term sequencing
- current plan, goal, PR, issue, or acceptance oracle when present
- recent closeout signal: shipped commit, archived backlog, PR status, or
  blocker note

Prefer live files and commands over remembered thread state. If external facts
would determine the next move, say which fact is missing rather than guessing.
Do not treat one empty scoped filter as absence of work. If a module/repo
filter returns nothing but the operator asked for that product area, broaden by
status, prefix, module id/name, open PRs, and verification/residual items before
recommending work outside that area.

## Report Shape

```markdown
**Next**
- State:
- Best next:
- Why this wins:
- My action:
- Your action:
- First move:
- Alternatives:
- Stop condition:
```

Keep it compact. The default answer should fit on one screen.

## Routing Judgment

Routing signals per `/orient`'s table (`../orient/SKILL.md`) — this skill adds
only the next-specific framing: recommend one path and defend it, always
separating agent-owned action from user-owned external action.

## Gotchas

- Do not return only a menu. Recommend one path and defend it.
- Do not collapse user-owned and agent-owned work. "Call this person" is not
  an agent task unless the tool can actually do it.
- Do not redefine success around what is easy to do locally. Name the real
  acceptance or blocker.
- Do not recommend a new repo just because the active repo has no
  `ready_for_dev` items. Check verification, in-progress, recently shipped PRs,
  and blocked/prerequisite items first; finishing or proving existing work
  usually beats starting a new ticket.
- Treat title/description blockers as real even when status says ready. Name the
  prerequisite instead of presenting the item as immediately deliverable.
- Do not start a delivery workflow unless the user asked you to act or passed
  `--act-if-safe` and the first step is reversible.
- Do not answer from stale memory when a live repo/status read is cheap.
- Do not over-explore. If the next move is obvious after status/backlog/branch,
  stop and report.

## Verification

When editing this skill in the roster source repo:

```sh
cargo run --locked -p roster-cli -- check
```

Semantic acceptance: a useful `/next` answer names current state, one best next
move, why it wins, my action, your action, the first move, alternatives, and a
stop condition.
