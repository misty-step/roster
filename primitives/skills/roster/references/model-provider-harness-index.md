# Model / Provider / Harness Index

Factual context for composition design. This reference is evidence input for a
lead agent, not a routing policy. It must not prescribe role fit, preferred
team shapes, or "best for X" judgments. The lead agent chooses compositions
from the current task, current repo evidence, runtime probes, receipts, and
this factual sheet.

## Freshness Contract

- Review due: 2026-08-05.
- Treat model facts as stale after the review due date.
- Verify exact model ids, availability, prices, context windows, and benchmark
  claims from live provider docs or catalogs before changing defaults.
- Record local smoke evidence in delegation receipts; this file may point at
  receipts, but receipts remain the proof that a local harness invocation ran.

## Live model facts: the OpenRouter MCP

The OpenRouter MCP is the live source for everything in this file that rots.
It is a remote HTTP server, user-scoped so it is available in every repo:

```sh
claude mcp add --scope user --transport http openrouter https://mcp.openrouter.ai/mcp
claude mcp login openrouter   # one-time OAuth (browser); issues a 7-day, $10-cap key
```

Tools: `models-list` / `model-get` / `model-endpoints` (catalog, providers,
live pricing), `benchmarks` (third-party quality scores), `rankings-daily`,
`credits-get` (balance), `generation-get` (per-call cost/tokens), `chat-send`
(billable test inference), `docs-search`, `ping`. Use it to verify slugs,
prices, and context windows before changing defaults, and to compose a
`/council` bench from current top diverse families. Quote prices at dispatch
time; never hardcode them into gates.

## Local Harness Roster

Source: `.harness-kit/agents.yaml`, probed with
`cargo run --locked -p harness-kit-checks -- probe-agent-roster` on 2026-06-14.

| Provider target | Harness / CLI | Active model id | Dispatch surface | Local probe status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `codex` | OpenAI Codex CLI | `gpt-5.5` | `codex exec --model gpt-5.5 --config model_reasoning_effort="medium"` | available |
| `pi` | Pi coding agent via OpenRouter | `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code` | `pi -p --no-extensions --provider openrouter --model moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code --thinking xhigh` | available |
| `goose` | Goose CLI via OpenRouter | `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code` | `goose run --provider openrouter --model moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code --text` | available |
| `opencode` | OpenCode CLI via OpenRouter | `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code` | `opencode run --model openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code --variant max --format json` | available |
| `claude` | Claude Code CLI | `claude-opus-4-8` (also `claude-fable-5`, `claude-sonnet-5`) | `claude -p --model claude-opus-4-8 --effort xhigh` | available; fable-5 verified live as a session model 2026-07-08 |
| `agy` | Antigravity CLI | `gemini-3.5-flash` | `agy --dangerously-skip-permissions --print` | available |
| `cursor-agent` | Cursor Agent CLI | `composer-2.5` | `cursor-agent -p --model composer-2.5` | available |
| `grok-build` | xAI Grok Build CLI (v0.2.91) | `grok-4.5` (CLI default; `grok-4.3` retained as cheaper 1M-ctx fallback) | `grok --model grok-4.5 --reasoning-effort high -p` (4.5 effort tiers: low/medium/high) | available; grok-4.5 sentinel dispatch passed 2026-07-08 |
| `oracle` | Oracle browser consult | `gpt-5.5-pro-browser` | `npx -y @steipete/oracle --engine browser --model gpt-5.5-pro -p` | available via `npx`; dry-run smoke passed 2026-06-16 |
| `manual` | Human/imported evidence | none | manual summary | manual |

Local probe status proves only command discovery. It does not prove task
quality, current billing, tool-call reliability, or benchmark performance.
Oracle status proves only the browser-mode dry-run path; Harness Kit forbids
Oracle API mode in its skill and roster defaults.

## Realtime And Speech Substrate Snapshot

Source: primary provider docs checked on 2026-06-20. This section is factual
input for product boundary decisions; it is not a default-provider policy.

OpenAI:

- Realtime guide positions `gpt-realtime-2` for low-latency voice agents and
  `gpt-realtime-whisper` for streaming transcription.
- Realtime conversations support function calling and out-of-band responses
  (`conversation: "none"`), which fits side-channel classification/proposal
  work that should not speak into the main conversation.
- `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize` supports `diarized_json` speaker-aware segments
  through `/v1/audio/transcriptions`; OpenAI docs state it is not yet supported
  in the Realtime API.
- Sources:
  <https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/realtime>,
  <https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/realtime-conversations>,
  <https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/speech-to-text#speaker-diarization>.

Google Gemini:

- Gemini Live API supports low-latency realtime voice/vision interactions,
  tool use, audio transcriptions, and proactive audio controls.
- Gemini model docs list Gemini 3.1 Flash Live Preview for high-quality
  low-latency audio-to-audio dialogue and Gemini 2.5 Flash Live Preview for
  low-latency bidirectional voice/video agents with native audio reasoning.
- Sources:
  <https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api>,
  <https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models>.

Deepgram:

- Flux is positioned as conversational speech recognition for voice agents with
  model-integrated end-of-turn detection, configurable turn-taking dynamics, and
  ultra-low latency.
- Source: <https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/models-languages-overview>.

ElevenLabs:

- Scribe v2 supports speech recognition across 90+ languages, word timestamps,
  dynamic audio tagging, and speaker diarization up to 32 speakers.
- Scribe v2 Realtime is documented for realtime low-latency transcription and
  word-level timestamps; verify current diarization support separately before
  relying on realtime speaker labels.
- Source: <https://elevenlabs.io/docs/overview/capabilities/speech-to-text>.

Design implication for AI-first meeting products: deterministic code should
own approval, policy, event logs, sandboxing, schemas, and evals; semantic
proposal generation, speech understanding, and diarization should be shaped
against a model/provider capability surface first, with deterministic
heuristics only as explicit fallback or fixture paths.

## Substrate Assessment Addendum

Source: user-provided research report, "Modern coding-agent systems as
execution substrates", current through 2026-06-19.

Factual substrate distinctions to preserve in composition design:

- OpenCode is server/session-shaped: clients sit on top of a service with
  programmatic sessions, SDK/API access, plugins, tools, permissions, MCP, and
  structured event output. It is the strongest open candidate for custom
  code-centric review runners, but it is not a durable queue, sandbox, policy
  service, publisher, model gateway, or eval warehouse by itself.
- Goose is a portable MCP-driven workflow runtime with CLI/headless operation,
  recipes, subagents, broad provider support, and a large MCP extension
  surface. Prefer it when a lane spans code plus trackers, docs, browsers,
  chat, or internal tools.
- Pi is a minimal coding-agent harness with CLI/RPC/SDK, tree sessions,
  provider adapters, extensions, and skills. It is valuable for local
  hackability and peer lanes, but its default process permissions and lack of a
  built-in permission system mean unattended production use needs an external
  sandbox and control plane.
- OMP is a heavier local engineering environment built around Pi-style
  workflows, with LSP/debugger/worktree/subagent affordances. Treat it as an
  expert local surface, not the organization-wide production control plane.
- OpenHands is the heavier open self-hosted platform option for remote
  workspaces and issue-to-PR work; use it when operating a multi-user agent
  platform is the point, not for a lightweight review-only lane.
- Continue's official repository was reported read-only / no longer actively
  maintained; do not make it a new strategic dependency without fresh contrary
  evidence.
- Managed review products such as Cursor Bugbot, Greptile, CodeRabbit, Codex
  review, and Copilot are bake-off comparators before building commodity review
  machinery.

The security boundary is external to every row above: do not put model-provider
keys or GitHub write credentials inside a sandbox that can execute
repository-controlled code.

Kimi K2.7 Code sentinel dispatch receipts on 2026-06-14:

- Pi: `efd464ab-bed2-465c-9a89-b644822733ae`, succeeded after roster command
  added `--no-extensions`.
- Goose: `4f0b6928-7abc-4080-a0cb-1b195a7dd74a`, succeeded.
- OpenCode: `9601cf81-428f-4718-980f-15ee161b7b6e`, succeeded.

## Focused Lane Harness Projection

Roster dispatch can optionally use a `lane_harness.v1` manifest to project a
minimal child harness before launching a provider. This is for context hygiene:
the primary lead can give a lane only the local skills and external aliases
needed for its role instead of inheriting every globally installed Harness Kit
skill.

Use it when a lane has a narrow responsibility and extra skills would be
misleading, such as a CI-only critic, a docs-only verifier, or an implementation
lane that should not see shaping or grooming skills. Do not use it as a semantic
workflow engine, a permission system, or a substitute for the lead's judgment.

Minimum operating path:

```sh
cargo run --locked -p harness-kit-checks -- materialize-lane-harness \
  --manifest crates/harness-kit-checks/tests/fixtures/lane-harness.yaml

cargo run --locked -p harness-kit-checks -- dispatch-agent \
  --provider-target codex \
  --objective "bounded lane objective" \
  --input-ref "path/or/ticket" \
  --prompt-file /tmp/lane.md \
  --repo . \
  --lane-harness crates/harness-kit-checks/tests/fixtures/lane-harness.yaml
```

Manifest constraints:

- `provider_target` must match a provider id in the roster and the dispatch
  provider target.
- `model_override`, when present, must match the provider's roster model or one
  of its configured `model_variants` keys or values.
- `allowed_local_skills` must name existing first-party skills and cannot
  escape the repo `skills/` root.
- `allowed_external_aliases` must resolve to pinned aliases in `registry.yaml`.
- `fallback.on_provider_failure` is `record_and_return`; a failed Codex, Pi,
  Goose, OpenCode, Claude, Antigravity, Cursor, or Grok lane should produce
  evidence for the lead, not crash the whole composition.
- `fallback.replacement_policy` is `lead_explicit`; replacing a failed lane is
  a lead decision, not an automatic provider loop.

Runtime projection creates an ignored root under
`.harness-kit/tmp/lane-harness/<id>/`, links the allowed skills into the
known harness skill locations, sets child environment variables (`HOME`,
`CODEX_HOME`, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `PI_HOME`, `GEMINI_CONFIG_DIR`,
`GOOSE_CONFIG_DIR`, `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`), and removes the
root after dispatch unless
`--keep-lane-root` is supplied for debugging.

Receipt fields make projection auditable:

- `lane_harness_ref`: manifest path.
- `lane_harness_sha256`: manifest hash at dispatch time.
- `projection_status`: `projected` or `failed`.
- `failure_kind`: typed provider or projection failure such as
  `credits_exhausted`, `auth_required`, `missing_binary`, `probe_timeout`,
  `dispatch_timeout`, `nonzero_exit`, `sentinel_mismatch`, or
  `projection_failed`.
- `output_check`: optional sentinel verdict when `--expect-output` is used.

## Open-Model / OpenRouter Catalog Snapshot

Pi, Goose, and OpenCode can attempt OpenRouter model ids through their
configured dispatch surfaces. The rows below are OpenRouter catalog facts
captured with `curl -fsSL https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` on 2026-07-08.
A row here does not mean the model has been smoke-tested through every harness,
and it is not a recommendation. Record a delegation receipt before treating a
non-roster model as locally proven. OpenRouter rows describe OpenRouter
listings only; do not infer local Codex, Claude Code, Antigravity, Cursor, or
Grok CLI pricing or limits from them. `~...latest` ids are OpenRouter catalog
aliases. Detailed sections below carry extra source notes for selected rows;
this table is the scannable catalog snapshot.

Notable drift since the 2026-06-14 snapshot: `moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code` max
completion now lists 16,384 (was 262,144) — verify before long-output lanes;
`minimax/minimax-m2.7` repriced down ($0.18/$0.72); `z-ai/glm-5.2` supersedes
5.1 at 1M context for a third the price; OpenRouter `~x-ai/grok-latest`
tracks `grok-4.5` as of 2026-07-08.

## Verified Model Facts

### Anthropic Claude 5 family (Fable 5 / Mythos 5, Sonnet 5)

### xAI Grok 4.5

- Released 2026-07-08 (public API 2026-07-09 per launch coverage); not
  available in the EU until mid-July per the same coverage.
- Active local id: `grok-4.5` — the Grok Build CLI's default model
  (`grok models` readback, 2026-07-08).
- OpenRouter id: `x-ai/grok-4.5`; created 2026-07-08; context 500,000
  (xAI direct and OpenRouter agree); pricing input `$2.00/M`, output
  `$6.00/M`, cache read `$0.50/M`; xAI lists a long-context (>200K) tier at
  `$4/$12`. Aliases: `grok-4.5-latest`, `grok-build-latest` (xAI), and
  OpenRouter `~x-ai/grok-latest` tracks it as of 2026-07-08.
- Effort tiers: low/medium/high (default high) — the 4.3-era
  `--effort max --reasoning-effort xhigh` flags do not apply.
- Positioning per launch coverage (provider claim, not local proof):
  Opus-class quality, faster/cheaper/more token-efficient; trained with
  Cursor; #1 on the Harvey Legal Agent Benchmark at release.
- Local sentinel dispatch through Grok Build passed 2026-07-08
  (`grok --model grok-4.5 --always-approve -p` returned the expected
  sentinel).
- Sources: xAI `api.x.ai/v1/language-models` readback,
  `curl -fsSL https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`, `grok models`,
  and launch coverage — all 2026-07-08.

### xAI Grok Build CLI (harness facts)

- Local version 0.2.91 (`grok --version`, 2026-07-08); default model
  `grok-4.5`.
- Harness affordances verified from `--help`: `--best-of-n <N>` (parallel
  attempts, best-of selection, headless), `--check` (appended
  self-verification loop, headless), `--agents <JSON>` inline subagent
  definitions plus `--agent <name|file>`, `--json-schema` constrained
  structured output, `--worktree`, plan/permission modes, cross-session
  memory (`grok memory`, `--experimental-memory`).
- Assessment input, not policy: with 4.5 as default this is now a credible
  coding/agentic lane, not just a chat surface — verify per task with a
  sentinel dispatch before relying on it for substantive lanes.

### xAI Grok 4.3

- Local id: `grok-4.3` — retained as a cheaper 1M-context fallback
  (OpenRouter `$1.25/M` in, `$2.50/M` out on 2026-07-08).
- `grok-4.20` / `grok-4.20-multi-agent`: OpenRouter lists 2M context; xAI
  direct lists 1M — treat the discrepancy as unresolved provider drift.
- Source: https://docs.x.ai/developers/models/grok-4 and the OpenRouter
  catalog readback on 2026-07-08.

### OpenAI GPT-5.5 Through Codex

- Active local id: `gpt-5.5`.
- Local dispatch surface: Codex CLI `codex exec --model gpt-5.5`.
- Local Codex CLI config runs `gpt-5.5` at `model_reasoning_effort = "xhigh"`
  (codex-cli 0.142.5, `~/.codex/config.toml` readback 2026-07-08) — the
  `*-codex` OpenRouter slugs are catalog listings for other harnesses, not
  what the local surface runs. `gpt-5.3-codex` (2026-02-24) is a dated
  catalog row kept only for price comparison; do not compose new lanes on it.
- OpenRouter facts (2026-07-08): 1,050,000 context, `$5.00/M` in,
  `$30.00/M` out, cache read `$0.50/M`; `gpt-5.5-pro` at `$30/$180`.
- GPT-5.6 (Sol/Terra/Luna) previewed 2026-07 at `$5/$30`, `$2.50/$15`,
  `$1/$6` — trusted-partner/Codex access only as of 2026-07-08, with GA
  expected 2026-07-09 (operator, 2026-07-08). This section's facts expire
  at that release: `openai_reference_review_due` below fires the
  `roster check` WARN the day after, forcing a post-GA refresh (exact ids,
  prices, Codex CLI default, OpenRouter availability) before anyone quotes
  the 5.5-era rows as current.

### Google Gemini 3.5 Flash Through Antigravity

- Active local id: `gemini-3.5-flash`.
- Local dispatch surface: Antigravity CLI `agy --print`.
- Reported facts (2026-07 coverage): GA since I/O 2026; `$1.50/M` in,
  `$9.00/M` out; 1M context; native Search grounding.
- Gemini 3.5 Pro: NOT GA as of 2026-07-08 — surfaced via
  Antigravity/LMArena testing only, no official model card or pricing;
  the strongest callable Google lanes today are 3.5 Flash and
  `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` (`$2/$12`, 1M, per the same coverage).
- Sources: 2026-07 coverage (tokenmix.ai, VentureBeat); verify against
  ai.google.dev model docs before changing a default.

### Cursor Composer 2.5

- Active local id: `composer-2.5`.
- Local dispatch surface: Cursor Agent CLI `cursor-agent -p --model composer-2.5`.
- Source for local availability: `.harness-kit/agents.yaml` plus
  `probe-agent-roster` on 2026-06-07.
- Public model-card/pricing/context facts were not verified in this refresh.
  Do not infer pricing, context, or benchmark facts from the local model id.

## Refresh Procedure

Use `/harness-engineering models` or `/research` when this file is stale
or a user asks for current model/provider/harness choices.

1. Read `.harness-kit/agents.yaml`, harness settings, and this file.
2. Probe local providers with `cargo run --locked -p harness-kit-checks -- probe-agent-roster`.
3. Query live provider catalogs/docs for exact model ids, context windows,
   max output, pricing, tool support, release dates, and deprecation notes.
4. Update this file with hard facts only.
5. Update `.harness-kit/agents.yaml` and harness settings only when changing a
   runnable default or variant.
6. Run `cargo run --locked -p harness-kit-checks -- probe-agent-roster --validate-only`.

Do not add subjective labels such as role fit, taste, or task suitability to
this file. Put task-specific composition rationale in the run's receipts,
context packet, or final debrief.
