  Enumerates the peer AI agent CLIs installed on this machine (codex, pi,
  goose, opencode, claude, cursor-agent, grok, agy, hermes, oracle)
  and how to invoke each headlessly. A capability map, not a quota: useful
  for fresh-context adversarial review on a different model family, second
  opinions, competing attempts, and wide benches. Use when: "ask codex",
  "ask another model", "second opinion", "cross-model review", "what AI
  tools do I have", "other agents", "different model family", "adversarial
  critique from another provider". Trigger: /roster.

# /roster

You are not the only frontier agent on this machine. These CLIs are
installed and each runs headlessly. They are options, not obligations:
native subagents remain the default delegation path, and a peer harness
earns a lane only when you can name what it adds — usually a decorrelated
model family or a genuinely fresh context.

## When a peer harness beats a native subagent

- **Adversarial critique of your own work.** A reviewer from a different
  model family has decorrelated failure modes and no loyalty to your
  reasoning. Critics get the artifact and the oracle only — never the
  author's reasoning trail (shared AGENTS.md: Fresh context beats
  self-review).
- **Second opinion on a contested judgment** — architecture call, risk
  assessment, "is this idiomatic" — where one model's taste shouldn't
  decide alone.
- **Competing attempts** at the same bounded problem, graded blind.
- **Wide bench** — high-stakes adversarial review (a P0, a security or
  data-loss surface, a pre-ship "be exhaustive" pass). Fan the artifact
  across several *distinct* open-model families via Pi/OpenRouter, each
  critic on its own lens; distinct families surface distinct real findings
  instead of confirming each other. See **Adversarial bench** below.

A native subagent is still better for exploration, scoped builds, and
anything where harness identity doesn't matter — it shares your tools,
needs no cold start, and the orchestrator is trained on it.

## The CLIs

Verified installed and probed 2026-06-14 (grok re-probed 2026-07-08). Each
row is the headless form; add the prompt as the argument or via stdin.

| CLI | Stack | Headless invocation |
|---|---|---|
| `codex` | OpenAI Codex (gpt-5.6-luna) | `codex exec "<task>"` (`--model`, `--config model_reasoning_effort=`) |
| `pi` | Pi over OpenRouter (Kimi, DeepSeek, …) | `pi -p --no-extensions --provider openrouter --model <id> "<task>"` |
| `goose` | Goose over OpenRouter | `goose run --no-session --quiet --provider openrouter --model <id> --text "<task>"` |
| `opencode` | OpenCode over OpenRouter | `opencode run --model openrouter/<id> --format json "<task>"` |
| `claude` | Claude Code (Opus/Fable) | `claude -p "<task>"` (`--model`, `--effort`) |
| `cursor-agent` | Cursor (composer) | `cursor-agent -p "<task>"` |
| `grok` | xAI Grok Build (grok-4.5 default) | `grok -p "<task>"` (`--model`, `--reasoning-effort`, `--best-of-n`, `--check`, `--json-schema`) |
| `agy` | Antigravity (Gemini) | `agy --print "<task>"` |
| `hermes` | Hermes agent | `hermes -z "<task>"` (`-m <model>`) |
| `oracle` | Oracle browser consult | `npx -y @steipete/oracle --engine browser --model gpt-5.5-pro -p "<task>" --file <paths>` |
Current model ids, pricing, context windows, and freshness dates:
`primitives/skills/roster/references/model-provider-harness-index.md`.
Model and harness facts rot in days, and the ranking of favorites is itself
perishable — a drop like Grok 4.5 (2026-07-08: Opus-class at $2/$6) can
reorder the bench overnight. `roster check` warns when the index is past its
review-due date; a WARN, a new frontier release, or a composition decision
the index can't settle each trigger a refresh (/research or
/harness-engineering models) before dispatching on remembered facts.

## Adversarial bench

High-stakes review is a *model-family spread*, not one second opinion:
distinct families each catch distinct real bugs (in one P0 pass, one family
found a startup-bricking blocker, another a null-timestamp escape, another a
write-path gap — no overlap).

- **3–5 distinct families** (Kimi/Moonshot, DeepSeek, MiniMax, Qwen,
  GLM/Zhipu when listed). Same-family variants don't decorrelate — a wide
  bench of one family is waste.
- **Discover slugs live**: `pi --provider openrouter --list-models
  <family>`. Slugs rot in days; substitute when a family isn't listed.
- **One distinct lens per critic** (correctness/data-loss, durability,
  security, perf, API-shape — `primitives/shared/references/lenses.md`).
  Optionally load that lens or a domain skill into the critic: `pi --skill
  <path>`.
- **Cold, bounded, artifact-only**: inline diff + oracle + context, run `pi
  -p --no-extensions --no-tools --provider openrouter --model <slug>
  "<prompt>"`, background the lanes, synthesize the verdicts yourself. Add
  one or two native critics on their own lenses (a further family), then
  re-review the *delta* after you fix.

Scale to stakes — a routine diff gets one well-aimed cross-family critic,
not the full bench.

## Judgment

- One well-aimed critic beats three vague ones. Aim it at the claim that
  would embarrass us in production, with explicit "ignore style/naming"
  bounds.
- Peer output is evidence, not authority. You weigh it, accept or reject
  it, and own the result.
- A failed or rambling lane is a result too — report it, don't re-roll
  silently.
- Oracle is browser-mode only in Roster. Use it for high-context consults
  through a signed-in ChatGPT session; do not use Oracle API mode or multi-model
  API panels from the Roster default.
- For a bounded lane whose evidence should outlive the session, write the
  receipt to Powder — a run, comment, or link on the card the lane's work
  feeds. Optional for quick second opinions; useful when the lane's verdict
  feeds a ship decision.
- Heavy, long-running, or isolation-needing lanes run on sprites
  (`/sprites`) regardless of which CLI executes them.

## Gotchas

- Peer CLIs run cold: no conversation history, no local skills unless the
  harness loads them itself. Inline everything the lane needs.
- Auth rots independently per CLI. A lane failing instantly with an auth
  error means re-login locally, not a provider verdict.

## Prompting frontier lanes

For Fable and GPT-5.6 Luna lanes (and the lead's own operation), load
`primitives/shared/references/prompting-frontier.md`: goal-not-steps briefs
fenced by house rules, executable bars (delegate metric-invention when the
bar is fuzzy), builder-never-grades verification against the REAL output,
loop-until-the-bar with a live status artifact, prior traces as fuel, and
budgets instead of permission-asks. Cheaper models still earn more
mechanism — tune the prescription to the concrete model and reasoning effort.
