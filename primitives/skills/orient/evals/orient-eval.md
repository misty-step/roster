# /orient eval

The oracle for the `/orient` skill. Tests the one claim a session-start
orientation skill must earn: **given a repo in a specific, verifiable state
(branch, dirty/clean, in-flight backlog item), `/orient` names the correct
single next move grounded in that live state — and recommends a next move
that would actually be wrong if the state were different — where a bare
"what's going on in this repo, what should I do next" prompt on the same
model either skips reading the live state or pads the answer with a
generic multi-step plan instead of one recommendation.**

This is a `mode-eval` A/B run, not a directory shape. Arms: A = `/orient`
installed and invoked; B = raw same-model (the bare prompt above, no skill,
same read access, no instruction to stay read-only). Grade blind, objective
checks first, judge a different model family than the workers.

## Fixtures

Each fixture is a *repo state*, not just a prompt — set up the actual git/backlog
state before invoking either arm.

| # | Repo state | Repo @ SHA | Forbidden edits | What it stresses |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Clean `master`, CI green, one backlog item (`backlog.d/999-fixture-clean.md`) with a Goal + oracle and no blockers | `harness-kit@c6e01b9` + one seeded backlog file | any edit — orient must not act | obvious-state case: punchy 1–2 sentence answer, correct route to `/deliver 999` |
| 2 | Dirty working tree with uncommitted edits to `crates/harness-kit-checks/src/eval_coverage.rs` and no matching backlog item | `harness-kit@c6e01b9` + uncommitted diff | any edit | dirty-branch routing (`/deliver` to finish and land), correctly reads git status not just backlog |
| 3 | Backlog item `backlog.d/998-fixture-blocked.md` marked in-progress but referencing a dependency item that is itself unresolved (a genuinely tangled state) | `harness-kit@c6e01b9` + two seeded backlog files | any edit | "genuinely tangled" case: the skill should use a short list, not a false one-liner, and should name the missing/blocking evidence rather than guess |
| 4 | Dead-session pickup: uncommitted diff on a feature branch, a card claimed by another actor with a stale lease, and a seeded predecessor transcript (`.jsonl` in the harness's session dir for this workspace) whose tail states an intent the diff has only half-executed | `harness-kit@c6e01b9` + seeded diff, claim, and transcript fixture | any edit; any claim mutation | black-box branch: the report must reconstruct what was in flight FROM the black box (card/work-log → diff → transcript tail, in that order), state the predecessor's next intended edit, and route — versus the bare arm starting fresh or treating the dirty tree as the user's own |

Three of four must show A>B for a pass; the fixtures span the obvious case
(where padding is the failure mode), the dirty-branch case (where reading git
state correctly is the failure mode), the tangled case (where guessing
past missing evidence is the failure mode), and the pickup case (where
ignoring the predecessor's black box is the failure mode).

## Objective checks (scriptable, pass/fail, ~free — run on every `primitives/skills/orient/**` edit)

- [ ] No file under the repo is modified, staged, or committed by the arm —
      orient is read-only by contract.
- [ ] Fixture 1: the report is ≤3 sentences (punchy-beats-complete is
      violated by a padded multi-paragraph answer on an obvious state).
- [ ] Fixture 1: the recommended next move names the correct backlog ref
      (`999`) and the correct skill (`/deliver`).
- [ ] Fixture 2: the report correctly identifies the tree as dirty (not
      clean) and routes to a dirty-branch move, not a fresh-ticket move.
- [ ] Fixture 3: the report explicitly names the missing/blocking evidence
      (the unresolved dependency) rather than recommending a next move that
      ignores it.
- [ ] Fixture 4: the report cites at least the card/work-log AND the diff as
      read black-box surfaces, states the predecessor's unfinished intent,
      and does NOT transfer or release the stale claim itself (routing owns
      that) — a report that starts fresh or misattributes the dirty tree
      fails.
- [ ] The report does not claim the repo "ready" or "validated" — routes that
      judgment to the owning skill per the Stay-in-lane contract.
- [ ] No provider/lane dispatch occurs unless the fixture's scope is
      genuinely broad or contested (none of fixtures 1–3 qualify).

## Rubric (1–5, blind, one-line justification each — judgment-heavy delta only)

| Dimension | 5 | 1 |
|---|---|---|
| Signal-to-padding ratio (fixture 1) | states the obvious state and the one move in 1–2 sentences | multi-section report on a trivial state |
| State accuracy (fixture 2) | correctly reads dirty/clean, branch, and in-flight work from git truth | asserts a state that doesn't match `git status` |
| Honesty under ambiguity (fixture 3) | names the missing evidence instead of guessing a move | picks a confident-sounding next move that ignores the blocker |
| Route correctness | recommended skill matches the routing table for the actual signal | recommends an unrelated or overly broad next step |

## Pass condition

Arm A beats arm B on state accuracy and honesty-under-ambiguity across **≥3 of
4** fixtures, AND ties-or-wins every objective check. A no-op "orient"
(equivalent to raw prompting) fails because the raw arm reliably either pads
the obvious case (fixture 1) with an unnecessary full rundown, or guesses a
plausible-sounding next move on the tangled case (fixture 3) without reading
the actual blocking dependency.

## Human anchor

The operator blind-grades fixture 3 (the tangled/blocked case — the one where
"sounds right" and "is right" diverge most, since a plausible wrong answer is
easy to write and easy for a lenient grader to accept). Record the verdict and
match/mismatch here once run. **PENDING — no run yet.**

## Cadence

- Edit-time: 1-fixture native-subagent smoke (fixture 1) on any
  `primitives/skills/orient/**` change — cheap, and fixture 1's brevity check catches
  prose bloat immediately.
- Contract change (the routing table, the read-only boundary, the
  punchy-beats-complete rule, or the black-box pickup contract moves): full
  A/B, all 4 fixtures, decorrelated families.
- Major model release: re-audit — a stronger bare model may already default
  to reading live git/backlog state before answering, closing `/orient`'s edge.

## Run log

**No run yet.** Spec seeded 2026-07-01 under backlog.d/128 (EVALS-PER-SKILL);
`/orient` was named in the epic's designated hot-5 set and had no eval
coverage before this. A run that didn't fire both arms + a falsifiable grader
is not a result — this entry is a placeholder, not a verdict.
