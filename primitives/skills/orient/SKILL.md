  Fast session-start repository orientation from live local evidence. Use when:
  "orient yourself", "start of session", "new session", "where are we",
  "catch me up before acting", after compaction,
  after switching worktrees, or before choosing a workflow. Trigger:
  /orient, /ground, /session-start.

# /orient

Ground the session in repo truth — not memory, not a stale summary. Read-only,
fast.

## What it produces

A short, natural read of where things stand and the one move that follows. You
are writing to stop a wrong first step, not to fill a form. In plain prose,
cover only what the evidence supports:

- where we are (repo, branch, clean vs dirty) and what's in flight;
- the single best next move, why it wins, and what would make it wrong.

Punchy beats complete. A sentence or two when the state is obvious; a short list
only when it's genuinely tangled. No fixed template, no field-by-field rundown,
no history dump. If the user already gave a precise command and the state is
clear, that sentence is the whole report. `--deep` is the only license to dig.

Example, obvious state: *"On `master`, clean, CI green. Shaped ticket 058 is the
only thing in flight and nothing blocks it — next is `/deliver 058`."*

## Where the signal lives

Read the smallest set that explains the workspace; skip whatever the prompt
already settled. Beyond the obvious (`git status`, branch, recent commits):

- scoped then repo `AGENTS.md`; `VISION.md`/`project.md` for focus (`README.md` only if still unclear)
- active work from the board of record: Powder queues (`list_ready`,
  `in_progress`, `verification`, `blocked`) via the powder MCP/CLI; a repo
  running on files uses `backlog.d/*.md`, `_done/`, and `Closes-backlog:` trailers
- roster probe (`roster list` / roster MCP) — only when the next move is a delegation

## Routing

Recommend one next skill. If the signal is mixed, name the missing evidence
rather than guess from vibes.

| Signal | Next |
|---|---|
| Shaped ticket, clean branch | `/deliver <ticket>` |
| Dirty branch, intended changes | `/deliver` (finish and land) |
| Dirty worktree, unclear ownership | Classify paths, then commit by concern or ask one scope question |
| Unshaped idea, unclear acceptance | `/shape` |
| Empty or stale backlog | `/groom` |
| Open prioritized backlog, no active branch | `/groom` summary, then one pickup |
| Failure, broken gate, unclear root cause | `/diagnose` |
| Item already in verification | `/qa` or closeout before new delivery |
| Running surface needs proof | `/qa` |
| Finished work needing closeout | `/deliver` (Land it), then `/compound` if a reusable lesson |
| Human external blocker | Say the agent is blocked; do not invent process work |
| Readiness or profile question | `/qa` or the repo's readiness surface |
| "What happened / why does it matter" | `/orient --deep` or `/shape` |
| Skill or harness primitive change | `/harness-engineering` |

## Stay in lane

Orient reads; it never acts. Don't deliver, groom, refactor, reflect, debrief,
mine transcripts, or mutate state. Don't label the repo "ready" or "validated" —
route that to the owning skill. Don't store session memory; durable state lives
in backlog, commits, and receipts. Don't spin up provider lanes unless scope is
broad, stale, or contested. Scoped `AGENTS.md` governs — respect it.

## Verification

Editing this skill in the roster source repo:

```sh
cargo run --locked -p roster-cli -- check
```

Invoked in another repo, that command isn't required — acceptance is the
report's cited live evidence and a next move the operator can act on.
