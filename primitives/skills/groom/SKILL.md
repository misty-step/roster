description: |
  Always-on backlog grooming. Tidy, brainstorm, interrogate, investigate,
  research, and simplify in a single loop. Tidy is not a mode — it happens
  every time. Strategic-layer work is a mega-sweep: swarm investigation,
  external research, critique, synthesis, and backlog shaping across product,
  codebase, docs, infrastructure, ops, architecture, system design, value prop,
  and agent readiness.
  Use when: "groom", "what should we build", "rethink this", "biggest
  opportunity", "backlog", "prioritize", "backlog session",
  "audit skills", "skill quality audit".
  Trigger: /groom, /groom audit, /backlog, /rethink, /moonshot, /scaffold.

# /groom

Keep `backlog.d/` true and make the project more ambitious. Normal strategic
`/groom` is a mega-sweep, not triage: boil the ocean on purpose, then distill
it into a world-class plan and backlog diff. A groom that only lists, lightly
prioritizes, or emits a tiny handful of issues is incomplete unless the user
explicitly scoped the run down.

The backlog diff is the artifact. Prose exists to justify it. Groom is a
conversation at the seams where the operator's judgment is the scarce input.
At intake, interrogate the operator on ambition, vision deltas, and hidden
priors so the sweep aims true — the `grill-me`-style posture in
`primitives/shared/references/interrogate-first.md` is the default here, not a
fallback gated on whether they arrived with a backlog item. The investigation
sweep itself stays autonomous — explore the codebase for what it can answer;
reserve interrogation for the operator's judgment, not for facts you can read.

julius-caveman for interim synthesis only; findings, code, commits, and final
artifacts stay normal English.

## Project Vision

Every strategic groom creates, refreshes, or explicitly validates a durable
project vision before ranking work; without one, brainstorming and backlog
movement collapse into local cleanup.

Read root VISION.md when present; if missing or stale, route to /vision
(shared AGENTS.md: Vision). Groom's delta: it drafts the smallest durable
vision artifact itself when none exists — prefer root `VISION.md`;
`docs/product.md`, a roadmap doc, or a named backlog epic only when repo
evidence says root vision is the wrong fit — and treats that draft as a
first-class groom emission rather than waiting on a separate `/vision` pass.

- Keep the vision concrete: audience, job-to-be-done, category, standards,
  non-goals, strategic bets, and what excellent looks like in 6-12 months.
- Revise the vision when live evidence contradicts it; don't bury direction
  changes in chat, issue comments, or the final report only.
- Backchain: themes and tickets should say which part of the vision they
  advance, de-risk, simplify, or deliberately reject.
- A vision or moonshot artifact can carry a one-glance system map when
  relationships or sequencing are too complex for prose alone:
  `primitives/shared/references/image-generation.md`.

## Tidy (mandatory, mechanical)

Tooling owns closure; consume it, don't hand-roll it:

```sh
default="$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')"
cargo run --locked -p harness-kit-checks -- backlog ids-from-range "origin/${default:-main}..${default:-main}"
cargo run --locked -p harness-kit-checks -- backlog archive "$id"   # idempotent
```

- Archive every ticket closed by `Closes-backlog:`/`Ships-backlog:` trailers
  or marked done/shipped in frontmatter. Commit as
  `chore(backlog): archive shipped tickets swept by /groom`.
- Flag stale `in-progress` (merged/deleted branch, or 30+ days untouched).
- Surface duplicates with a proposed consolidation — never merge silently.
- **Backlog size is telemetry, not policy.** If the active queue looks too
  broad, report the evidence: count, age, duplicates, stale owners, orphaned
  themes, and unfocused small items. Consolidate only when tickets genuinely
  share one outcome. Never veto an evidenced emission because of an arbitrary
  item count.

Trailer canon lives in `meta/CONTRACTS.md`. Emit trailers only via
`git interpret-trailers`; hand-formatted variants are invisible to tooling.

## Delegation

Delegate per the shared Roster contract (shared AGENTS.md: Roster). Strategic
grooming is high-stakes by declaration and defaults to the swarm: independent
lanes for product/value, operator experience, runtime reliability,
architecture, simplification/deletion, security/privacy, docs/onboarding,
ops/infra, testing/verification, agent readiness, and external exemplars,
with the lead keeping final prioritization. Routine grooming — a tidy-only
pass, a scoped ticket check — scales the bench down to the stakes per the
Roster contract instead of running the full swarm.

## Mega Sweep

For any strategic groom, load `references/mega-groom.md`. It is the contract
for swarm size, coverage map, source matrix, output shape, and the
"world-class plan" bar. Use `references/investigation-bench.md` only for lane
prompt shapes; it is a template library, not the whole run.

## Ambition Floor

Calibrate scope to what frontier agents can execute, not what a human team
can staff. Execution is cheap; vision is the scarce input. Strategic grooming
must describe the best version of the whole project, then backchain from that
standard into epics, deletions, sequencing, and first pickups.

- **Brainstorm deep, from perspectives composed for this repo.** There is
  no canonical list of layers to sweep. Pick the obvious axes this codebase
  demands, then add lenses no stock list would hand you — invert a premise,
  borrow from an adjacent domain, ask what a competitor, operator, or
  first-time user would notice. Fan the perspectives out as parallel
  fresh-context lanes; pull in `/research` when outside knowledge would
  change a verdict. When the sweep keeps returning the obvious (the *mundane
  harvest* failure), route the divergence through `nous-creative-ideation` — a
  routed library of named methods (lateral provocations, analogy/biomimicry,
  premortem-and-inversion) that manufactures non-obvious lenses on purpose. The
  bar is genuine diversity and depth of exploration, judged fresh each session.
- **Describe the best version of this software,** not the next safe
  increment: elegant, easy to change, personalizable, delightful,
  operationally boring, and valuable enough to matter. The distance between
  that vision and the live repo is backlog material; close it with epics.
- **Epic-scoped by default.** Strategic emissions are epics — a product
  outcome with an ordered child sequence — never pre-shredded tasks. Small
  items exist as children of an epic or as genuine isolated fixes.
- **Ambition is not slop.** Every epic's premise survives the same vetting
  as any finding: open the file, run the command. A perspective that comes
  back with "all fine here" is making a claim — vet it like one. The floor
  raises scope, not tolerance for unevidenced claims.

## Judgment (the actual grooming)

Investigate before opining. A tidy-only pass exists, but only when the user
asks for one; any other session owes the `references/mega-groom.md` sweep,
with genuinely independent perspectives run in parallel and `/research` when
outside context would change a verdict. Fresh-context lanes exist to
decorrelate judgment, not to fill a roster.

- **Read the live code, not just ticket text.** Hotspots, debt
  concentrations, the oldest stuck ticket. Every codebase has findings;
  "everything is fine" means the investigation was shallow.
- **Challenge premises of the top items.** Symptom or root cause? A ticket's
  framing is a first draft. Reframe before re-ranking.
- **Propose deletions.** The best groom shrinks the backlog. Every deletion
  is a proposal with rationale — humans ratify removals.
- **Audit the repo's own harness.** Agent readiness is backlog work, not a
  separate ceremony: does this repo have a verification skill with its real
  routes/commands (the highest-impact skill category)? Verified build/test/
  lint commands and conventions an agent can discover cold? Runbooks for
  its deployed surfaces? A CI gate that would catch the likely failure?
  A meaningful, enforced quality floor that gates the diff and ratchets legacy
  debt, or only advisory, arbitrary gates
  (`primitives/shared/references/quality-gates.md`)? Security gates that catch
  secret leaks in files and Git/PR metadata before publication? Stale
  AGENTS/CLAUDE prose? Product context a cold agent would need? Each gap is a
  ticket like any other.
- **Vet findings before presenting them.** Re-check each claim against the
  live repo — open the file, run the command. A plausible finding that
  doesn't survive a second look is noise that erodes trust in the whole
  groom.
- **Theme, then recommend.** Group findings by shared root cause, rank by
  impact discounted by confidence — effort barely discounts now that agents
  execute — and argue for one concrete action per theme. Synthesis stays on
  the lead; when the plan is contestable, land it with the operator the same
  `grill-me` way — walk the decision tree (sequencing, deletions, the next
  pickup) one branch at a time, recommending each — instead of dropping the
  full plan for a rubber-stamp.

## Ticket Format

`backlog.d/<nnn>-<kebab-slug>.md` with Goal + Oracle always, plus a
Verification System for M+/ready work — full template, epic shape, and
promotion rules: `references/ticket-format.md`.

## Audit Mode

`/groom audit` is a read-only harness-health report, not a grooming run:

```sh
cargo run --locked -p harness-kit-checks -- telemetry --repo .
```

It summarizes skill/prompt usage from hook logs (and staleness vs last
edit). Read it with judgment: low usage with high value-when-used is fine —
say so; low usage with no story is a deletion candidate. Present findings
ordered by severity; do not auto-fix.

## Refuse

- Never auto-delete or silently merge tickets.
- Never archive a ticket whose trailer points at an unmerged branch.
- Never let backlog size alone veto an evidenced ticket or epic.
- Never skip the swarm on a strategic/mega-sweep groom when subagent, peer
  CLI, or sprite lanes are available — it's high-stakes by declaration; if all
  delegation is blocked, report degraded mode and do the local matrix.
  Routine grooming may scale the bench down per the Roster contract.

## Gotchas

- **Menu, not grooming.** Themes without a defended recommendation are a
  report. Pick one action per theme and argue it.
- **Mundane harvest.** A strategic session that only finds small, safe work is
  not done. Widen the swarm, add external research, invert the premise, and
  inspect neglected surfaces before concluding the repo has no ambitious,
  evidence-backed moves.
- **Stock-lens grooming.** Running the same investigator roster in every
  repo is process, not thought. The revealing perspectives are the ones
  composed for this codebase, this session.
- **Over-decomposing.** An agent-hour of work is one ticket, not three; a
  coherent multi-ticket ambition is one epic, not ten orphan tasks.
- **Backlog as graveyard.** Age is a stale signal, not an automatic verdict.
  Inspect branch, owner, and live relevance before flipping, archiving, or
  proposing deletion.
- **Accepting the ticket's framing.** Five-whys the top items before
  re-ranking them.

## Completion Gate

See `primitives/shared/AGENTS.md` (Completion Evidence, Closeout) for the
shared core; this phase adds:

1. **Tidy diff** — archived, flipped, flagged; by ID, no padding.
2. **Source matrix** — swarm lanes, local commands, external research,
   skipped/failed lanes, and what each contributed.
3. **World-class plan** — vision, gaps, themes, sequencing, deletion/
   consolidation candidates, and the one best next pickup.
4. **Emissions** — epic/ticket edits with `**Why:**` naming the evidence
   lane; strategic emissions show breadth across the domain map, not just
   the easiest implementation slice.
5. **Residual** — open questions, blocked dependencies, unverified areas,
   and what would make the sweep stronger.

`/groom audit` scores skill quality separately (see Audit Mode above);
backlog mechanics are enforced by `harness-kit-checks backlog` subcommands.
Apply non-destructive backlog edits when the user asked for grooming;
deletions, abandonments, and silent merges stay proposals unless explicitly
approved. A groom run ends with a clean tree: archives committed, emissions
written, deletions awaiting ratification.
