# /harness-engineering

Engineer the harness. Keep it thin.

When changing Roster itself, read root `VISION.md` first. Its v0.2 catalog and
compiler boundary supersedes this skill's historical workstation-sync wording;
do not extend `sync`, `doctor`, or service faces as target product surfaces.

Repo-local skills for consumer repos (bespoke QA drivers, deploy runbooks,
persona probes) are written directly into that repo's `.agents/skills/`
with its real routes and commands; this skill owns the craft either way.
Process, provenance header, and eval-stub shape:
`references/repo-local-skill-generation.md` +
`templates/repo-local-skill/`. For a repo's verification skill, interview
the operator first: the manual checks they run after the agent responds and
before merge are the spec — encode each check that has a tool. Turning a
proven session pattern into a first-party primitive starts at the primitive
test below — most patterns are prompts, not skills.

## Contract

- Fix root cause in the highest-leverage layer: type/test/hook/gate/skill/
  AGENTS, in that order.
- Prefer deletion. Harness prose is context tax.
- Use Ponytail before adding or expanding primitives, provider layers,
  harness-specific accelerators, gates, wrappers, or skill prose. The lazy
  viable path has to lose on evidence before a larger harness mechanism earns
  its place.
- Cross-harness first means filesystem + `SKILL.md` portability. Prefer
  smoke-tested open-model peer lanes through Pi, Goose, and OpenCode on
  OpenRouter; keep Claude, Antigravity, Cursor, and Grok conditional unless
  their specific surface answers the task.
- Skills stay self-contained: scripts/libs/references under the skill; state
  roots from invoking repo.
- Code outside a skill serves only Roster source-repo maintenance,
  generated artifacts, bootstrap/install, or harness configuration. It is not a
  place for skill behavior.
- Treat a skill as a folder, not a markdown file. Use scripts, references,
  examples, templates, assets, evals, or append-only data when prose would
  make the agent reconstruct repeatable work.
- Model/provider/harness selection facts live in the roster skill
  (`primitives/skills/roster/references/model-provider-harness-index.md`). Keep that
  file factual: model ids, context, price, latency/smoke evidence, tool
  support, benchmark sources, deprecations, and freshness. Do not encode
  role-fit policy there; the lead agent composes task-specific teams from
  current evidence.
- Roster source skills live in `primitives/skills/`; repo-local `.agents/skills/` and
  harness-specific skill bridge dirs are `/seed` output for consumer repos.
- Generated/root `AGENTS.md` is a router, not a manual. Keep non-obvious facts
  only.
- Roster's resolved bundle exposes the selected skill catalog; repo-local
  vendoring is exceptional and must earn its complexity. The current
  `roster sync` implementation is legacy migration input, not the target.
- Provider CLIs are tools. Do not wrap them in semantic orchestration unless a
  shaped ticket explicitly asks.
- Harness-specific accelerators (e.g. orchestration-workflow templates) may
  ride inside a skill folder as assets the prose names as optional — a
  harness without the feature must lose nothing by ignoring them. Build one
  only after telemetry shows the pattern recurring; never pre-author.

## Delegation Judgment

Delegate per the Shared Operating Spine (Act).

Local lane guidance: Use lanes for doctrine critique, runtime compatibility, gate design, and regression risk. Do not treat a missing repo-local roster as a waiver; use the resolver-backed probe.

## Primitive Test

Before creating or growing anything, classify it (2026-06 audit):

- **Local prompt** — "is this just what the operator would retype to a strong
  model?" Keep it in chat, local scratch, or a skill template only when a skill
  truly needs reusable wording. Do not add a repo-level prompt layer. If the
  operator expects Codex app slash or `$` discovery, use a skill instead.
- **Skill** — "does this change what a frontier model does, for the better,
  repeatedly?" Judgment + context the model can't derive.
- **Doctrine line** — "worth paying for in every session?" Goes in AGENTS.md,
  not a folder.
- **Mode B** — event-triggered (on PR-ready, on production error, on
  schedule)? It belongs in the event plane (bitterblossom), not this harness.
  This repo is the ad-hoc operator layer plus the shared disk contracts.
  Load `../../shared/references/loop-readiness.md` before proposing any
  unattended loop.

History: slash commands were collapsed into skills when skills arrived, so
saved prompts masqueraded as skills and the catalog tripled. Do not recreate
that. Counter-history: Codex app discovery is skill-shaped, so high-frequency
operator commands that must appear in the app are skills even when their body is
lightweight.

## Quality Bar

- `SKILL.md` encodes judgment, not a procedure the model already knows.
- Frontmatter descriptions are model trigger classifiers, not human summaries:
  include explicit `Use when:` phrases and `Trigger:` aliases.
- Instruction prose is compression, not literature. Sacrifice grammar before
  clarity; keep terse imperatives, named failure modes, and concrete oracles.
- Put long mode detail in `references/`; keep the entry file short.
- Build gotchas from repeated agent failures. If a gotcha can be asserted by a
  script, hook, or eval, codify it there and point the skill at the artifact.
- Ad-hoc roster lanes beat static project subagents unless tool permissions
  must be isolated.
- New mechanisms include a verification system: gate, eval, benchmark, QA
  path, smoke path, or probe that can fail for the real error.
- Every run ends clean: no untracked or modified files.

## Post-Sync Acceptance

After changing skills, shared doctrine, generated docs, bootstrap, roster, or
harness projections, prove the output is repo-fit, not merely structurally
valid.

```markdown
## Acceptance Evidence
- Live repo evidence read: source skill, shared doctrine, generated docs, bootstrap output, roster, or harness projection inspected.
- Acceptance source: backlog oracle, skill contract, generated index/docs contract, bootstrap contract, or explicit absence.
- Evidence that proves it: command output, diff, generated artifact, bootstrap transcript, or gate output.
- Exact command/path/route exercised: check, generator, bootstrap, smoke path, projection path, or route run.
- Oracle / acceptance artifact hash: sha256 digest for any fixture, generated artifact, transcript, or contract used as the oracle, or state that no artifact-backed oracle exists.
- Contract-change acknowledgment: reason when the change alters an acceptance contract, generated source, or assertion surface, or state that no contract changed.
- Repo-fit check: source/generator/projection agree; no stale generated docs, wrong skill root, stale command, or copied bridge remains.
- Structural gate: `cargo run --locked -p roster-cli -- check` result, or the specific sub-gate exercised.
- Residual risk: skipped harness, external dependency, or none with reason.
```

## Gotchas

- Phase prose is not judgment. Frontier models know the SDLC; a skill that
  restates implement/refactor/review steps is railroading (Anthropic's own
  top skill lesson: don't state the obvious, avoid railroading). Encode the
  bespoke part — oracles, repo facts, taste — or nothing.
- Process bureaucracy trains checkbox compliance, not quality. Multi-field
  completion gates, oracle hashes, and learning-packet ceremonies get filled
  in plausibly by strong models. Verification is tests, CI, and driving the
  live surface.
- Evals, benchmarks, and QA are verification systems only when they have a
  driver, grader, evidence packet, and cadence. A directory, prompt, or
  transcript with no falsifier is not proof.
- Deterministic scaffold is the historical failure mode here: agents unsure
  of harness engineering fall back to Rust/scripts that enforce prose. Every
  gate must answer "what real failure did you catch in the last 90 days?" —
  no answer, delete it.
- Check telemetry before adding or keeping a skill. The 2026-06 audit found
  ~15 of 36 skills unused; usage is a power law. Low usage with high
  value-when-used is fine (say so); low usage with no story is deletion.
- A new frontier model release silently converts some skill prose from
  judgment into railroading: instructions tuned for the last model anchor
  the new one to stale patterns. After a major model ships, re-audit skill
  and doctrine prose; prefer deleting an instruction over updating it.
- Name harness features by capability, not vendor. "Use the harness's
  large-scale orchestration feature when it has one" degrades gracefully
  across harnesses; "use dynamic workflows" confuses every harness that
  lacks them.
- Meta-work ratio: if this repo's commit rate rivals the product repos',
  the flywheel is feeding itself.
- Stale AGENTS prose is worse than missing prose.
- Duplicated repo-local skill copies are usually stale context unless a repo
  needs checked-in vendored harness state.
- Generated catalog/docs drift means the source skill changed but the harness
  projection did not.
- Unsupported invocation hooks mean usage telemetry is structurally shaped but
  not empirically proven for that harness.
- Structural eval trees are not semantic proof; objective graders must assert
  behavior or carry an explicit waiver.
- Helper scripts that are not wired into a gate become optional folklore.
- Regexes over agent prose are usually the wrong boundary.
- If a rule matters, enforce it outside prose.

## Verification

Run `cargo run --locked -p roster-cli -- check` (plus fmt/clippy/test) after
changing harness primitives, gates, roster, bootstrap, or sync logic. For
bootstrap changes, also re-run bootstrap and confirm installed skills/configs
match the source tree and retired prompt/example links are pruned.
