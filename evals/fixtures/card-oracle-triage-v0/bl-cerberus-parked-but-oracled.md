# Adopt the Misty Step comic-ops aesthetic baseline

Priority: P4 · Status: parked · Estimate: M

## Goal
Evaluate and adopt the operator-pulp comic-ops flavor for Cerberus review
artifacts, rendered Markdown/HTML, and publication previews.

## Oracle
- [ ] `DESIGN.md` or project docs name the chosen flavor, likely
      `operator-pulp`, and the rendering surfaces it governs.
- [ ] A representative `ReviewArtifact.v1` rendering is mocked or rendered with
      context tiers, proof strips, finding ledgers, and verdict stamps.
- [ ] Aesthetic changes do not overstate inspected context or weaken artifact
      validation.
- [ ] The implementation uses `@misty-step/aesthetic` commit `9bbe0f9` or later,
      or records a deliberate no-adoption decision.
- [ ] `./scripts/verify.sh` passes after implementation.

release, projection, and orchestration epics. Reopen only after the review organ
is reliable and measured enough to deserve more presentation polish.
